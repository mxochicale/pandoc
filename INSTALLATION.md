# Ubuntu (Waiting for testing in a new machine!)
Required tools for producing the pdf

You'll need [pandoc](http://pandoc.org) (a universal document converter) and a
full [TeX distribution](https://www.tug.org/texlive/).

For pandoc, you'll also need the
[pandoc-crossref](https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref) filter that you can
easily install with:

```
$ cabal update
$ cabal install pandoc-crossref
```
